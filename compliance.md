# Compliance — Swiss Medical Device Import (MepV / Swissmedic)

**Date:** February 2026  
**Context:** Switzerland is not in the EU. Swiss medical device law (MepV, SR 812.213) is separate from EU MDR, though heavily aligned. Swissmedic is the competent authority.

## ⚠️ Key Difference from Smart Home Business

Unlike the LVEO (electronics), Swiss medical device import has **Swissmedic as active regulator** — not just self-declaration. The obligations are more specific and require formal registration as an economic operator.

## 1. Classification of Core SKUs

### Kinesiology Tape — Likely NOT a Medical Device

If sold without therapeutic/medical claims ("for muscle support", "for physiotherapy"), kinesiology tape is a textile product. No Swissmedic involvement.

**Safe framing:** Describe as "elastic adhesive tape" with "5cm × 5m" dimensions. Do not write "treats pain", "therapeutic", "medical use" on packaging or website.

**Recommendation:** Before selling, submit a free pre-consultation enquiry to Swissmedic (swissmedic.ch → Medizinprodukte → Anfrage stellen) asking specifically whether your kinesiology tape requires notification under MepV. Get the answer in writing. Takes 2–4 weeks.

### Resistance Bands, Paper Rolls — Not Medical Devices

Exercise/lifestyle products. No MepV obligation. Sell freely.

---

### TENS Electrode Pads — Class IIa Accessory

**Classification:** Accessories to a Class IIa active therapeutic device (TENS/EMS unit) are classified by MDR Annex VIII Rule 2 as Class IIa themselves.

**What this means:**
- CE marking required (from EU Notified Body — the manufacturer should already have this)
- Swissmedic economic operator registration required (you as importer)
- Unique Device Identification (UDI) may apply (for Class IIa)
- Importer must maintain records of: DoC, CE certificate, lot traceability, any incidents

**Action steps:**
1. Register as economic operator with Swissmedic (free, online at swissmedic.ch)
2. Obtain from Chinese supplier: CE certificate + DoC referencing EU MDR 2017/745
3. Verify the EU Notified Body listed on CE certificate is currently accredited (check nando.ndo.ec.europa.eu)
4. Keep importer records for 10 years (MepV requirement)

### Ultrasound / Contact Gel — Class I (likely)

**Classification:** Contact gel is non-invasive, contacts only intact skin, and performs no therapeutic function itself (it's a coupling medium). Under MDR Annex VIII Rule 1: Class I.

**Class I obligations:**
- Manufacturer self-declaration (CE marking based on own Declaration of Conformity)
- No Notified Body required
- Swissmedic economic operator registration still required if sold as medical device
- Or: sell as "general purpose gel, not for medical use" — then no MepV obligation. Many physio gels are sold this way.

**Recommended approach:** Source gel that the Chinese manufacturer already sells with a CE DoC as Class I. Simpler than managing a non-classified product that could be challenged.

---

## 2. Swissmedic Economic Operator Registration

**Mandatory for any Class I+ medical device placed on the Swiss market.**

- Register at: swissmedic.ch → DAPIVO portal (Datenbank der Akteure und Produkte in der MED. Verordnung)
- Registration is free and takes 1–2 weeks
- You must provide: company details, types of devices you'll import, QMS confirmation
- Once registered, you appear in the Swissmedic database as a Swiss economic operator
- Annual reporting: update if product range changes

## 3. Practical Compliance Checklist (Per SKU)

For each medical device SKU:

- [ ] Obtain CE certificate from Chinese supplier (must be issued by EU Notified Body)
- [ ] Verify Notified Body is currently accredited (NANDO database)
- [ ] Obtain Declaration of Conformity referencing EU MDR 2017/745 (not the old MDD)
- [ ] Check UDI on product label if Class IIa (required from May 2023 for Class IIa)
- [ ] Register as economic operator with Swissmedic (once, covers all products)
- [ ] Add your company details as Swiss importer on product label / insert
- [ ] Set up traceability record (spreadsheet: lot number, supplier, quantity, customer)
- [ ] Establish incident reporting procedure: if a customer reports a device-related injury, must report to Swissmedic within 15 days (serious) or 30 days (non-serious)

## 4. MWST (VAT) — Same as Smart Home Business

- Import VAT 8.1% on declared value (reclaimable if MWST-registered)
- Voluntary registration recommended from day 1 (see smart home plan notes)
- Customs tariff codes for physiotherapy consumables:
  - Kinesiology tape (if textile): likely HS 5906.10 (rubberized textile) — duty: 0–4%
  - Gel: HS 3401 / 3402 — duty: 0%
  - Electrode pads: HS 9019.10 (massage/physiotherapy apparatus accessories) — duty: 0%

---

## 5. Summary: Phase-Gated Approach

**Phase 1 (no Swissmedic involvement needed):**
- Kinesiology tape (if no medical claims) — launch immediately
- Resistance bands — launch immediately
- Paper rolls — launch immediately

**Phase 1b (parallel, low barrier):**
- Ultrasound gel as Class I — register with Swissmedic, get supplier CE DoC

**Phase 2 (more compliance work):**
- TENS electrode pads (Class IIa) — register with Swissmedic, verify Notified Body cert, UDI check
