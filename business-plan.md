## 1. The Opportunity

**3,700 physiotherapy practices in Switzerland** buy consumables every week. They use electrode pads, kinesiology tape, ultrasound gel, and other supplies constantly — and they currently source from old-school distributors or German online shops with slow delivery, no Swiss B2B focus, and significant markup.

The market has one established Swiss online competitor (AcuMax Med AG) and several traditional distributors. No one has built a lean, online-first, B2B-only operation targeting the physio consumables segment specifically with Swiss pricing, fast delivery, and a professional account model.

**The thesis:** We can buy direct from Chinese manufacturers at 60–80% below what Swiss physios currently pay, import with proper compliance in place, and sell at 30–40% below current Swiss retail while maintaining 40–55% gross margins.

## 2. Market

### Size
- **~3,700 physiotherapy practices** in Switzerland (vertriebslisten.ch, 2025)
- Growing shortage: CH trains 500–600 physios/year but needs 800–1,000 → demand growing faster than supply
- Trend: consolidation into larger "Grosspraxen" — better for B2B (fewer but larger orders)
- Average practice: 2–5 therapists, 20–40 patient treatments/day

### Consumable spend (estimated per practice per year)
| Item | Annual spend estimate |
|---|---|
| TENS/EMS electrode pads | CHF 400–1,200 |
| Kinesiology tape | CHF 800–2,400 |
| Ultrasound gel | CHF 300–600 |
| Resistance bands / loops | CHF 200–500 |
| Paper/hygiene rolls | CHF 300–600 |
| Miscellaneous (cupping, massage tools) | CHF 200–400 |
| **Total per practice** | **CHF 2,200–5,700/year** |

**Total addressable market (CHF):** 3,700 practices × CHF 3,500 avg = **~CHF 13M/year** in consumable spend  
**Realistic year-1 target:** 50 practices at avg CHF 3,000/year = CHF 150K revenue

### Customer profile
- Small private physio practices (2–5 staff) — buy monthly, price-sensitive, time-poor
- Larger group practices (5–15 staff) — bulk orders, want account management and invoice
- Hospital physio departments — purchasing through procurement → harder to reach initially
- Sports clinics / sports associations — high volume, tape-heavy

## 3. Product Range — Phase 1

Focus on low-regulation, high-volume, high-margin items first. Defer medical device registrations for Phase 2.

### Core SKUs

| Product | Swiss retail price | Our target sell price | Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kinesiology tape (5cm × 5m, per roll) | CHF 8–14 | CHF 4.90–6.90 | Not a medical device* |
| Kinesiology tape (5cm × 32m, bulk roll) | CHF 35–55 | CHF 19.90–24.90 | Not a medical device* |
| TENS/EMS electrode pads (4× 50×50mm) | CHF 8–16 | CHF 4.90–7.90 | Class IIa accessory† |
| Ultrasound / TENS contact gel (1L) | CHF 18–28 | CHF 9.90–13.90 | Class IIa† |
| Ultrasound / TENS contact gel (5L) | CHF 60–90 | CHF 29.90–39.90 | Class IIa† |
| Resistance bands (set of 5) | CHF 18–35 | CHF 9.90–15.90 | Not a medical device |
| Disposable paper rolls (50cm × 80m) | CHF 12–20 | CHF 7.90–10.90 | Not a medical device |

*Kinesiology tape sold without therapeutic claims = not a medical device (textile/adhesive). Verify with Swissmedic.  
†Class IIa items require Swissmedic notification as importer — see `compliance.md`.

### Phase 2 expansion (after compliance established)
- Rubber/carbon reusable electrodes
- Therapeutic hot/cold packs
- Foam rollers (various densities)
- Theraband-equivalent resistance bands
- Cupping sets (silicone)

## 4. Business Model

**B2B only.** No consumer sales. Minimum order CHF 50.

- **Online ordering:** B2B webshop with account registration, order history, invoice download
- **Account structure:**
  - Standard: standard pricing, pay by card or bank transfer
  - Pro (5+ orders/year): 8% discount, net-30 invoicing
  - Partner (10+ orders/year or 500+ CHF/month avg): 15% discount, dedicated contact, priority shipping
- **Fulfilment:** ship from own stock (initially home/small storage). No dropship — quality control requires own inventory.
- **Delivery:** Swiss Post Priority (next-day within CH). Orders placed before 14:00 → dispatched same day.

## 5. Competitive Position

### Competitors

| Competitor | What they do | Weakness |
|---|---|---|
| **AcuMax Med AG** (acumax.ch) | Broadest Swiss online physio shop — equipment + consumables. DE/FR/IT/EN. | Not B2B-focused; sells to consumers and pros alike; prices not optimized for bulk; sells branded products at retail margins |
| **massagebedarf.ch** | Online shop, tape + accessories | Mixed B2C/B2B; limited SKU depth; no account management |
| **ChMedica** (chmedica.ch) | B2B equipment + consumables | Traditional catalogue model; mostly equipment, fewer consumables; less price-competitive |
| **German web shops** | Many physios order from DE | Customs complications post-2021 (though minimal for small orders), no Swiss invoicing, slower delivery |
| **Enraf-Nonius / Chattanooga** | Premium equipment brands | No consumable focus; premium pricing; sold through distributors only |

### Our edge
1. **Price** — 30–40% below current Swiss market on equivalent quality
2. **Speed** — same-day dispatch, next-day Swiss Post delivery (AcuMax doesn't guarantee next-day)
3. **B2B focus** — net-30 invoicing, account management, bulk pricing tiers, no minimum for established accounts
4. **Swiss compliance** — Swissmedic-registered importer (AcuMax resells branded products; we import direct)
5. **Depth** — curated SKU set for exactly what physios consume weekly, nothing more

### The "AcuMax question"
AcuMax is the most serious competitor. Their exact consumable pricing is not fully confirmed (see `research/competitor-pricing.md`). Before committing to this business, their prices must be verified. If AcuMax is already pricing at 60–70% of European retail, our margin to beat them shrinks significantly.

## 6. Compliance — Summary

Switzerland is not in the EU. Medical devices imported into Switzerland must comply with Swiss MepV (Medizinprodukteverordnung), administered by Swissmedic.

**Importer obligations (MepV Art. 18):**
- Register as economic operator with Swissmedic (free, online)
- Ensure imported devices bear CE marking (CE + EU Declaration of Conformity)
- Maintain traceability records
- Report serious incidents to Swissmedic

**By product category:**

| Product | Classification | Swissmedic obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Kinesiology tape (no medical claims) | Not a medical device | None — verify with Swissmedic |
| Resistance bands, paper rolls | Not a medical device | None |
| TENS electrode pads | Class IIa accessory | Importer registration + CE required |
| Ultrasound gel | Class I or IIa | Importer registration + CE required |
| Cupping sets | Class I (if medical claim) | Importer registration + CE required |

Full details in [`compliance.md`](compliance.md).

## 7. Go-to-Market

### Phase 1: Validate (Months 1–2)
- Order samples of 8–10 SKUs
- Test quality, verify Chinese supplier DoCs and CE certs
- Build webshop on Shopify
- Contact 20 physio practices directly (Physioswiss member directory)
- Offer: "Free first order — try our tape/gel, no risk"

### Phase 2: First 50 customers (Months 2–5)
- Advertise on Physioswiss platform / newsletter if available
- Target Physioswiss Grosspraxen-Anlass attendees (they explicitly have large-practice events)
- Partner outreach: sports associations (FC Zürich physio, cantonal sports federations)
- Convert free-trial customers to accounts

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 5–12)
- Add Phase 2 SKUs as compliance is established
- Introduce volume tiers and account management
- Explore private-label branding on core SKUs (kinesiology tape most obviously)

### Target customer acquisition cost
- Direct outreach: essentially zero (time only)
- Physioswiss advertising: investigate — budget CHF 500–1,000 for trial
- Target: CAC < CHF 50 per account; LTV > CHF 2,000/year per account

## 9. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| AcuMax already price-competitive | Medium | Verify prices before building. If gap is <20%, reconsider. |
| MepV compliance burden higher than expected | Medium | Start with non-medical-device SKUs. Consult Swissmedic before launch. |
| Chinese supplier quality inconsistency | Medium | Multi-supplier sampling, quality test before each bulk order |
| Physios have strong brand loyalty (Kinesio, etc.) | Medium | Offer free samples; price speaks. Most physios are pragmatic. |
| German suppliers ship to CH cheaply anyway | Low | German order = no CH invoice, customs admin for physio. We remove that friction. |
| Market too small for viable business | Low | 3,700 practices × CHF 3,500/yr = CHF 13M TAM. 1% share = CHF 130K. Viable for side business. |
