# Launch Checklist — Swiss Physio Consumables

**Status:** Pre-launch  
**Updated:** February 2026

---

## 🔴 Phase 0 — Before Anything Else (Week 1)

These are verdict-determining. Do these before spending a franc.

- [ ] **Check AcuMax prices** — Visit acumax.ch, add to cart: tape 5m roll, tape 32m roll, TENS 4-pack 50×50mm, ultrasound gel 1L and 5L. Screenshot all prices. Compare to our target prices in `financials.md`. If AcuMax is already at ≤CHF 5 for a tape roll → re-evaluate before proceeding.
- [ ] **Check massagebedarf.ch prices** — Same process for their Kineasy tape and gel products.
- [ ] **Visit 3 physio practices in Zürich** — 15-min conversations, no selling. Ask: "Where do you buy consumables? What do you pay for tape / TENS pads / gel? Would you switch for 30% savings?" Take notes. This is the most valuable market research possible.
- [ ] **Pre-consultation with Swissmedic** — Submit online enquiry asking: (1) does kinesiology tape require MepV notification if sold without medical claims? (2) how is ultrasound gel classified? (3) what's the procedure for TENS electrode pad import? Free, takes 2–4 weeks.

## Phase 1 — Sampling & Validation (Weeks 1–3)

- [ ] Order sample kit from Alibaba (~CHF 155 total):
  - [ ] 50 rolls kinesiology tape 5cm×5m (from Aupcon or Kunshan Yuhuan — request free sample first)
  - [ ] 10 rolls kinesiology tape 5cm×32m
  - [ ] 20 packs TENS pads 50×50mm (from Quanding Medical — request CE DoC with sample)
  - [ ] 6 bottles ultrasound gel 1L
  - [ ] 3 jugs ultrasound gel 5L
  - [ ] 10 sets resistance bands
- [ ] Request CE Declaration of Conformity from each supplier with sample order
- [ ] Test all samples per protocol in `research/market-and-products.md`
- [ ] Verify Notified Body on TENS pad CE cert via NANDO database
- [ ] Assess tape quality: compare against Kinesio and RockTape on stretch, adhesion, skin reaction

---

## Phase 2 — Compliance & Registration (Weeks 2–4, parallel to Phase 1)

- [ ] Register with Swissmedic as economic operator (once Swissmedic pre-consultation confirms obligation — likely yes for TENS pads and gel)
  - URL: swissmedic.ch → DAPIVO portal
  - Free, allow 1–2 weeks
- [ ] Register for MWST (Swiss VAT) voluntarily:
  - URL: estv.admin.ch → ePortal
  - Reclaim import VAT from first inventory order
- [ ] Register Einzelfirma (if turnover expected >CHF 100K) or proceed informally below threshold
- [ ] Obtain product liability insurance — ask existing insurer if Produkthaftung covers imported consumables

---

## Phase 3 — Product & Brand (Weeks 3–5)

- [ ] Choose brand name for private label:
  - Options: neutral/clinical name ("PhysioSwiss Supplies", "AlphaPhysio", "Cura Supply")
  - Must not imply medical efficacy if tape sold as non-medical product
  - Register as .ch domain
- [ ] Design minimal label for kinesiology tape rolls:
  - Brand name, size (5cm × 5m / 5cm × 32m), color, country of origin (China), importer details (you, Swiss address), batch number
  - For non-medical tape: no medical symbols required
- [ ] Set up Shopify B2B webshop:
  - Products: tape (individual, bulk), TENS pads, gel, bands
  - B2B-only (require company name + UID at registration)
  - Payment: TWINT, Stripe (card), bank transfer (net-30 for Pro accounts)
  - Delivery: Swiss Post Priority, same-day cutoff 14:00
- [ ] Write German product descriptions (clear, professional, no medical claims on tape)
- [ ] Set up invoicing: Banana Accounting or Bexio (Swiss, CHF, MWST-compliant)

## Phase 4 — First Customers (Weeks 3–6)

- [ ] Build target list of 50 physio practices (starting in Zürich, Bern, Basel):
  - Source: vertriebslisten.ch has full address list of 3,700 practices (buy the list ~CHF 200–500)
  - Or: manual research via local Zefix search for "Physiotherapie" in target cantons
- [ ] Draft outreach email in German:
  > *"Wir sind ein Schweizer B2B-Anbieter für Physiotherapie-Verbrauchsmaterial — Kinesio-Tape, TENS-Elektroden, Ultraschallgel. Direkt importiert, 30–40% günstiger als übliche Anbieter, Lieferung nächsten Werktag. Ich würde Ihnen gerne ein kostenloses Muster schicken. Keine Verpflichtung."*

- [ ] Ship 10 free sample packs to interested practices (cost ~CHF 80–100)
- [ ] Follow up with all who received samples after 2 weeks
