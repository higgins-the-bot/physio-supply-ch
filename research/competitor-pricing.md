## AcuMax Med AG (acumax.ch)

The most important competitor. Swiss, online, 4 languages, stocks consumables and equipment.

| Product | AcuMax price | Confirmed? |
|---|---|---|
| TENS electrodes 50×50mm (4-pack) | ~CHF 8–12 (estimated) | ❌ Not confirmed — could not load price from page |
| Ultrasound gel 250ml | ~CHF 8–15 (estimated) | ❌ Not confirmed |
| Ultrasound gel 1000ml | ~CHF 18–30 (estimated) | ❌ Not confirmed |
| Ultrasound gel 5000ml | ~CHF 55–90 (estimated) | ❌ Not confirmed |
| Kinesiology tape 5cm×5m | Unknown | ❌ Not confirmed |

**⚠️ Action required: Manually check acumax.ch prices for all core SKUs before proceeding. This is verdict-determining for the business case.**

One data point found: a customer review mentioned AcuMax "came forward with about CHF 6.50" in a complaint resolution — context unclear, likely a discount applied to one item rather than a product price. Not sufficient to confirm anything.

## massagebedarf.ch

Swiss online shop, B2C/B2B mixed. Sells "Kineasy" brand kinesiology tape (own label = likely Chinese import).

| Product | massagebedarf price | Confirmed? |
|---|---|---|
| Kinesiology tape 5cm×5m (Kineasy Premium) | ~CHF 7–10 per roll (estimated) | ❌ Not confirmed — page failed to load |
| Ultrasound gel (cosiMed brand) | Unknown | ❌ Not confirmed |
| TENS electrodes | Unknown | ❌ Not confirmed |

**Note:** massagebedarf.ch selling tape under their own "Kineasy" label confirms the private-label import model is viable in this market. They got there first on tape, but likely haven't optimized for B2B physio clinics specifically.

## The Critical Check

Before building inventory or a webshop, visit (or call) 3–5 physio practices in Zürich and ask:
1. Where do you currently buy your consumables?
2. What do you pay per roll of kinesiology tape? Per 4-pack of TENS electrodes?
3. Would you switch supplier if the price was 30% lower and delivery was next-day Swiss?

This gives real pricing data AND customer validation in one conversation. Takes 2 hours of fieldwork and is more valuable than any online research.
