## 🚨 Market Gap Alert: Two Major Swiss Competitors Just Exited

**physioshop24.ch** — described as "one of the largest online shops for physiotherapy supplies in Switzerland" — has **ceased Swiss operations** (site notice: "Unsere Geschäftstätigkeit in der Schweiz wird leider nicht fortgeführt"). Their parent SVG Medizinsysteme GmbH & Co. KG continues in Germany and Austria but has abandoned the Swiss market.

**physio-shop.com** — closed **10 February 2026** (2 weeks ago). Site says: "Diese Website ist seit dem 10.02.2026 geschlossen."

Both were operating as German companies serving Swiss physios. They've both exited the Swiss market within the last few weeks. **This is a real, active market gap right now.** The physios they served need a new Swiss supplier.

## Active Swiss Competitors

### 1. AcuMax Med AG (acumax.ch)

**Status: Active.** The primary remaining Swiss online physio shop.

**Confirmed pricing:**

| Product | AcuMax price | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Nasara Kinesio Tape 5cm×5m | **~CHF 9.90/roll** | From set price: 36 rolls = CHF 356.60 → CHF 9.91/roll. Bulk deal: CHF 6.14/roll at 36+. |
| Leon Premium Tape XXL 5cm×32m | Unknown | Listed as product; price requires login or cart |
| Pre-cut Anwendungs-Tapes (Nasara) | CHF 5.50 → CHF 2.50 (sale) | Pre-cut strips, not rolls — different product |
| Ultrasound gel 250ml | **CHF 15.90** (from) | ✅ Confirmed — "ab 15.90 CHF" for 250ml/1000ml/5000ml range |
| Ultrasound gel 250ml+1000ml combo | ~CHF 64.70 → CHF 55.00 (sale) | ✅ Confirmed |
| TENS pads 50×50mm (4-pack CM5050) | **CHF 10.90** normal / **CHF 6.90** sale | ✅ Confirmed — "CHF 6.90 % CHF 10.90 (36.7% saved)" |

**Our price advantage vs. AcuMax (normal prices):**
- Kinesio tape 5cm×5m: CHF 5.90 vs CHF 9.90 = **−40%**
- TENS pads 4-pack: CHF 5.90 vs CHF 10.90 = **−46%**
- Ultrasound gel 1L: CHF 10.90 vs CHF ~22 (est.) = **~−50%**

**vs. AcuMax sale prices** (which they run regularly):
- TENS pads: CHF 5.90 vs CHF 6.90 = **−15%** — still cheaper, but thinner gap

**Key insight:** AcuMax sells **branded tape** (Nasara, well-known German brand). They're not selling generic/private-label. Their TENS pads are also a branded product (CM5050 = Boots-compatible generic). We can beat their normal price easily; we beat their sale price by a smaller but still real margin.

**Free delivery threshold:** CHF 250 (high — forces larger orders, disadvantages occasional buyers)

**AcuMax weakness:** They're a generalist (beauty, massage, TCM, fitness, hygiene, physiotherapy). No B2B account focus. Sells branded product at retail margins. No pro pricing visible. Their physio section is one of many.

### 2. kineasy.ch (+ massagebedarf.ch — same brand)

**Status: Active.** Dedicated Swiss kinesiology tape shop with own-brand "Kineasy" tape. Same operation as massagebedarf.ch.

**Confirmed pricing:**

| Product | Price | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Kineasy tape 2.5cm (extra narrow) | **CHF 10.40** | From search snippet — confirmed |
| Kineasy tape 5cm×5m | ~CHF 8–11 (estimated) | Standard width likely at a premium to 2.5cm |
| Kineasy tape 7.5cm (extra wide) | Listed | Price not confirmed |

**Key insight:** kineasy.ch is already doing exactly what we'd do for tape — importing Chinese tape under a Swiss brand. They got there first for tape, but they are **tape-only** and not B2B-focused. They don't sell gel, pads, bands, or other physio consumables. A physio buying from us gets everything in one order; from kineasy.ch they still need to go elsewhere for gel and pads.

---

### 3. frei-swiss.ch

**Status: Active.** Swiss physio/medical equipment shop. Focus on electrotherapy machines (CHF 1,590 devices). Limited consumables focus. Not a primary competitor for our consumables play.

---

### 4. fitshop.ch

**Status: Active.** General fitness/sports shop. Sells kinesio tapes from **CHF 16.70** upwards — these are branded consumer products (Bodyprox, Physix, etc.). Their prices are at the top of the market. Not a serious B2B physio competitor.

## Why Did physioshop24.ch and physio-shop.com Leave?

### physioshop24.ch (SVG Medizinsysteme GmbH & Co. KG)

**Who they were:** German company based in Mühlacker, Baden-Württemberg. In business since 1997. Described themselves as "one of the largest online shops for physiotherapy supplies in Switzerland." Had a Swiss PostFinance bank account (IBAN CH15), Swiss domain, Swiss delivery.

**Why they left:** No official statement beyond "Unsere Geschäftstätigkeit in der Schweiz wird leider nicht fortgeführt." (Our business activities in Switzerland will unfortunately not be continued.) Still operating in Germany and Austria.

**Most likely reasons (inferred):**
- Swiss regulatory burden: Foreign companies selling medical devices into Switzerland must comply with MepV (Swissmedic), which as of the 2022/2023 Switzerland-EU divergence requires more than just CE marking. German companies face additional complexity vs. a Swiss-domiciled importer.
- Swiss MWST administration: Separate Swiss VAT registration, reporting, and compliance is operationally costly for a German company where the Swiss market is a small fraction of total revenue.
- Customs overhead: Every shipment from Germany requires a customs declaration. Post-Brexit-equivalent friction for B2B shipments to Switzerland creates cost and delay that erodes margin on low-value consumables.
- Market size vs. overhead: Switzerland = ~9M people. Germany = ~84M. The Swiss operation may simply not have justified the administrative cost.

**The structural insight:** A Swiss-based importer (us) doesn't have any of these problems. We import once from China into Switzerland, comply with Swiss regulations as a Swiss company, charge Swiss MWST natively. This is a structural advantage over German competitors.

### physio-shop.com

**Who they were:** Online physio supply shop, German-language. Closed **10 February 2026**. Only message: "Diese Website ist seit dem 10.02.2026 geschlossen."

**Why they closed:** Unknown — no public statement, no insolvency notice found. Could be: owner retirement, inability to compete, voluntary closure, or business model failure. Timing (early 2026, same period as physioshop24.ch exit) may suggest broader German-operated CH physio supply businesses are struggling.

**What it means:** Another set of physio customers actively seeking a new supplier right now.

**Remaining unknown:** AcuMax prices on gel, pads, and bulk tape. AcuMax doesn't surface product prices in search results — requires cart or account login. Still needs physical verification.

## Competitive Landscape Summary

**Before this research:** AcuMax + physioshop24.ch + physio-shop.com + massagebedarf.ch = crowded-ish field.

**Today:** physioshop24.ch and physio-shop.com have both exited Switzerland in the last 2 weeks. Remaining: AcuMax (generalist, branded products), kineasy.ch (tape-only). **The market is less served now than it was a month ago.**

The ~3,700 Swiss physio practices that were ordering from physioshop24.ch are actively looking for a new Swiss supplier right now. This is a real acquisition opportunity if you move quickly.
