## 🚨 Market Gap Alert: Two Major Swiss Competitors Just Exited

**physioshop24.ch** — described as "one of the largest online shops for physiotherapy supplies in Switzerland" — has **ceased Swiss operations** (site notice: "Unsere Geschäftstätigkeit in der Schweiz wird leider nicht fortgeführt"). Their parent SVG Medizinsysteme GmbH & Co. KG continues in Germany and Austria but has abandoned the Swiss market.

**physio-shop.com** — closed **10 February 2026** (2 weeks ago). Site says: "Diese Website ist seit dem 10.02.2026 geschlossen."

Both were operating as German companies serving Swiss physios. They've both exited the Swiss market within the last few weeks. **This is a real, active market gap right now.** The physios they served need a new Swiss supplier.

## Active Swiss Competitors

### 1. AcuMax Med AG (acumax.ch)

**Status: Active.** The primary remaining Swiss online physio shop.

**Confirmed pricing:**

| Product | AcuMax price | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Nasara Kinesio Tape 5cm×5m | **~CHF 9.90/roll** | From set price: 36 rolls = CHF 356.60 → CHF 9.91/roll. Bulk deal: CHF 6.14/roll at 36+. |
| Leon Premium Tape XXL 5cm×32m | Unknown | Listed as product; price requires login or cart |
| Pre-cut Anwendungs-Tapes (Nasara) | CHF 5.50 → CHF 2.50 (sale) | Pre-cut strips, not rolls — different product |
| Ultrasound gel 250ml / 1000ml | Unknown | Listed; page doesn't show price without cart |
| TENS pads 50×50mm | Unknown | Listed as CM5050; page doesn't show price |

**Key insight:** AcuMax sells **branded tape** (Nasara, a well-known German brand). They're not selling generic/private-label. Nasara retail ~CHF 9.90/roll vs. our target CHF 5.90/roll = **40% cheaper.** Even vs. their bulk deal price of CHF 6.14, we're essentially at parity or marginally cheaper — but with our own brand and direct import margins.

**Free delivery threshold:** CHF 250 (high — forces larger orders, disadvantages occasional buyers)

**AcuMax weakness:** They're a generalist (beauty, massage, TCM, fitness, hygiene, physiotherapy). No B2B account focus. Sells branded product at retail margins. No pro pricing visible. Their physio section is one of many.

### 2. kineasy.ch (+ massagebedarf.ch — same brand)

**Status: Active.** Dedicated Swiss kinesiology tape shop with own-brand "Kineasy" tape. Same operation as massagebedarf.ch.

**Confirmed pricing:**

| Product | Price | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Kineasy tape 2.5cm (extra narrow) | **CHF 10.40** | From search snippet — confirmed |
| Kineasy tape 5cm×5m | ~CHF 8–11 (estimated) | Standard width likely at a premium to 2.5cm |
| Kineasy tape 7.5cm (extra wide) | Listed | Price not confirmed |

**Key insight:** kineasy.ch is already doing exactly what we'd do for tape — importing Chinese tape under a Swiss brand. They got there first for tape, but they are **tape-only** and not B2B-focused. They don't sell gel, pads, bands, or other physio consumables. A physio buying from us gets everything in one order; from kineasy.ch they still need to go elsewhere for gel and pads.

---

### 3. frei-swiss.ch

**Status: Active.** Swiss physio/medical equipment shop. Focus on electrotherapy machines (CHF 1,590 devices). Limited consumables focus. Not a primary competitor for our consumables play.

---

### 4. fitshop.ch

**Status: Active.** General fitness/sports shop. Sells kinesio tapes from **CHF 16.70** upwards — these are branded consumer products (Bodyprox, Physix, etc.). Their prices are at the top of the market. Not a serious B2B physio competitor.

| Ultrasound gel 5L | Unknown | Not sold | Not sold | **CHF 32.90** | Unknown |

## Competitive Landscape Summary

**Before this research:** AcuMax + physioshop24.ch + physio-shop.com + massagebedarf.ch = crowded-ish field.

**Today:** physioshop24.ch and physio-shop.com have both exited Switzerland in the last 2 weeks. Remaining: AcuMax (generalist, branded products), kineasy.ch (tape-only). **The market is less served now than it was a month ago.**

The ~3,700 Swiss physio practices that were ordering from physioshop24.ch are actively looking for a new Swiss supplier right now. This is a real acquisition opportunity if you move quickly.
