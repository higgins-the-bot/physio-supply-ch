## 1. Market Size

### Practices
- **3,700 physiotherapy practices** in Switzerland (vertriebslisten.ch, Oct 2025 data — they sell the complete address list)
- Physioswiss (the Swiss physio professional association) has ~10,000 individual member therapists
- Trend: consolidation into larger "Grosspraxen" — Physioswiss held a dedicated large-practice event in 2023/2024 acknowledging this structural shift
- Small practice: 1–3 therapists, 10–25 treatments/day
- Large practice (Grosspraxis): 5–20 therapists, 50–200 treatments/day

### Training shortage = demand growth
SRF reported (2018) that CH trains only 500–600 physios/year against demand of 800–1,000. This shortage has not resolved — it means existing practices are running full, driving high consumable throughput.

### Estimated consumable spend per treatment
| Item | Per treatment usage | Cost at current Swiss prices |
|---|---|---|
| Electrode pads | ~0.05 pad amortized (reused ~30×) | ~CHF 0.30 |
| Ultrasound gel | ~10ml | ~CHF 0.15 |
| Kinesiology tape | 0–30cm per patient (tape patients) | ~CHF 0.50–2.50 |
| Paper roll (table cover) | ~50cm | ~CHF 0.08 |
| Gloves | 1 pair (some treatments) | ~CHF 0.20 |
| **Total consumable cost per treatment** | | **~CHF 0.70–3.00** |

At 30 treatments/day × 250 working days × CHF 1.50 avg consumable cost = **CHF 11,250/year per therapist** in consumable spend. Even at half that (many treatments don't use all consumables): **CHF 5,600/year/therapist**.

### Addressable market
- Conservative: 3,700 practices × 2 avg therapists × CHF 3,000/year = **CHF 22M**
- More conservative (only consumables we'd stock): ~CHF 13M

## 2. Competitors

### AcuMax Med AG (acumax.ch) — Primary competitor

**The most important competitor to understand.** Swiss online shop, 4 languages (DE/FR/IT/EN), stocks physio equipment and consumables. Sells both B2C and B2B. Swiss company with Swiss delivery.

**Product categories relevant to us:**
- Electrotherapy / TENS accessories (electrodes, gel)
- Kinesiology tape
- Ultrasound gel
- Massage accessories
- Practice supplies

**What AcuMax does well:**
- Established Swiss brand, Swiss invoicing, fast delivery
- Wide range — everything from CHF 10 accessories to CHF 5,000 electrotherapy machines
- Multi-language

**What AcuMax does badly:**
- Mixed B2C/B2B (no pro pricing visible)
- Sells branded products at retail margins (Chattanooga, etc.) — doesn't go factory-direct
- No dedicated physio account management
- Prices not confirmed — **must verify before launch** (see `competitor-pricing.md`)

**The AcuMax risk:** If they're already cheap, we have a smaller gap to exploit. If they're at normal Swiss retail (+50% over direct import), we're fine.

---

### massagebedarf.ch — Secondary competitor

Swiss online shop focused on massage supplies, physio accessories. Sells kinesiology tape (own brand "Kineasy"), ultrasound gel, exercise bands, TENS accessories.

**Key observation:** They sell "Kineasy Premium" kinesiology tape — their own brand, almost certainly imported from China and relabelled. This is exactly the model we'd run. It means:
1. The model works — someone's already doing it
2. We need to check their pricing to understand how competitive the tape market already is

---

### ChMedica (chmedica.ch) — Equipment-focused

B2B medical equipment supplier. Mostly machines (ultrasound devices at CHF 1,439), not consumables. Less relevant for consumables competition but a reference for regulatory positioning.

---

### German web shops — Real competition

Many Swiss physios likely order from German shops (Amazon.de, physio-shop.de, etc.). Post-Brexit logic applies: ordering from Germany means:
- No Swiss customs declaration for small orders (below CHF 65 threshold, VAT-free)
- German VAT can't be reclaimed by a Swiss business (unlike Swiss MWST)
- No same-day Swiss delivery
- Mixed compliance (German CE ≠ automatically Swissmedic-compliant)

**This is our moat vs. German suppliers:** Swiss Swissmedic registration, Swiss MWST invoice (deductible for registered CH businesses), next-day Swiss Post.

## 3. Product Research — Specific Items

### Kinesiology Tape

**What it is:** Cotton/nylon elastic tape with acrylic adhesive. Applied to skin over muscles/joints. Used by ~60–70% of Swiss physios.

**Key specs:**
- Standard size: 5cm × 5m (single-patient roll, sold by box of 6–8 rolls typically)
- Bulk size: 5cm × 32m (practice roll — cut to length)
- Colors: typically beige, black, blue, pink, red, green (minimum: beige + black)
- Stretch: ~140–160% elasticity
- Water resistant, latex-free

**Swiss market pricing:**
- massagebedarf.ch "Kineasy Premium" 5cm × 5m: ~CHF 7–10/roll (estimated — couldn't load page)
- Generic from German shops: CHF 4–7/roll delivered
- Branded Kinesio Tex Gold: CHF 18–25/roll (Swiss retail)
- Branded RockTape: CHF 14–20/roll

**Chinese factory pricing (Alibaba/Made-in-China):**
- 5cm × 5m rolls: $0.50–1.20/roll at 500+ MOQ (OEM label possible at 1,000+ rolls)
- 5cm × 32m rolls: $1.80–4.00/roll at 200+ MOQ
- OEM minimum (custom label, custom box): typically 500–1,000 rolls per color/size combo

**Key Chinese manufacturers:**
- Aupcon (aupcon.com) — offers wholesale/OEM, free samples, exports to EU/CH
- Dongguan Haixiang — cost-effective for large orders (20,000+ units)
- Kunshan Yuhuan — flexible MOQ, good for smaller buyers
- WMDHC — MOQ=1 listed (likely reseller/trading company)

**CE/regulatory:** Kinesiology tape sold without therapeutic/medical claims = textile product, not a medical device. No CE required. No Swissmedic notification. Lowest regulatory burden of all SKUs.

**Verdict: Start here. Best risk/reward ratio.**

### TENS/EMS Electrode Pads

**What they are:** Self-adhesive electrode pads used with TENS, EMS, and IFT electrotherapy machines. Single-pad or 4-pack. Typically reused 20–40 times before adhesive degrades.

**Key specs:**
- Sizes: 50×50mm (most common), 50×100mm, 90×150mm
- Connector: 2mm round pin (most common), or snap connector
- Adhesive: gel-based, self-adhesive
- Material: carbon rubber or non-woven fabric

**Swiss market pricing:**
- AcuMax: 50×50mm 4-pack — exact price not confirmed; one review mentioned CHF 6.50 in a complaint context suggesting that was a discount/adjustment
- Typical Swiss retail: CHF 8–16 per 4-pack
- German online: CHF 4–8 per 4-pack

**Chinese factory pricing:**
- 4-pack 50×50mm: $0.80–2.00 at 500+ MOQ
- Custom size: small surcharge
- CE marking: available from established factories (Class IIa accessory certification obtainable)

**Key Chinese manufacturers:**
- Quanding Medical (quandingmedical.com) — dedicated TENS electrode manufacturer, CE docs available, B2B wholesale focus
- Boen Medical (boenmedical.com) — wide range of physio electrodes
- Guangzhou Janejoy Medical Technology

**CE/regulatory:** Electrode pads are accessories to a Class IIa medical device. Under MDR Rule 2 for accessories: classified alongside the device they're used with = Class IIa. Requires CE marking from Notified Body. Swissmedic importer registration required. More compliance work than tape, but manageable. **Phase 1b after tape is established.**

---

### Ultrasound / Contact Gel

**What it is:** Water-based conductive gel used as acoustic coupling medium for ultrasound therapy. Also used as conductive medium for TENS/EMS electrode pads.

**Key specs:**
- Viscosity: medium (should not run off skin)
- Color: typically clear, light blue, or light green
- Packaging: 250ml bottle, 1L bottle, 5L/5000ml jug (practice size)
- Hypoallergenic, water-soluble, non-staining

**Swiss market pricing:**
- AcuMax: 250ml, 1000ml, 5000ml sizes listed; prices not confirmed from our research
- ChMedica: listed but prices behind login
- Estimate based on German markets: 5L from German shop = €25–45; Swiss retail likely CHF 60–90 for 5L

**Chinese factory pricing:**
- 5L: $8–16 at 50+ units
- 1L: $2–4 at 100+ units
- CE marking: available as Class I or IIa medical device

**Regulatory:** Ultrasound gel is typically Class I (no therapeutic function, just coupling medium) or Class IIa. Likely Class I under MDR Rule 1 (non-invasive, in contact with intact skin). CE marking as Class I = manufacturer self-certification. Lower burden than TENS pads.

---

### Resistance Bands / Loops

**What they are:** Elastic bands used for physiotherapy exercises. Both long bands (therapy bands, "Theraband-style") and short loops.

**Not medical devices** — exercise equipment. No CE required.

**Swiss pricing:** CHF 4–8 per loop, CHF 8–18 per long band. Sets of 5 (different resistances): CHF 20–40.
**Chinese cost:** $0.50–2 per band. Set of 5: $3–6 at bulk.
**Verdict: Easy to source, good margins, no regulatory issues. Include from day 1.**

---

### Disposable Paper Rolls (Examination Table Rolls)

**What they are:** White or crepe paper rolls, typically 50cm wide × 80m long, placed on treatment tables for hygiene.

**Not a medical device.**

**Swiss pricing:** CHF 10–20 per roll.
**Chinese cost:** $2–5 per roll at bulk.
**Note:** Heavy/bulky — freight cost eats into margin. Consider domestic sourcing (e.g., Swiss or German paper mill) rather than importing from China. Investigate before adding.

## 4. Sampling Plan (Phase 1)

Buy sample quantities to verify quality before bulk orders:

| Item | Source | Sample qty | Est. cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kinesiology tape 5cm × 5m | Alibaba (Aupcon or Kunshan Yuhuan) | 50 rolls | ~$40 |
| Kinesiology tape 5cm × 32m | Same | 10 rolls | ~$25 |
| TENS pads 50×50mm 4-pack | Alibaba (Quanding Medical) | 20 packs | ~$25 |
| Ultrasound gel 1L | Alibaba | 6 bottles | ~$20 |
| Ultrasound gel 5L | Alibaba | 3 jugs | ~$35 |
| Resistance bands (set of 5) | Alibaba | 10 sets | ~$25 |
| **Total sampling cost** | | | **~$170 (~CHF 155)** |

**Test protocol for each:**
- Kinesiology tape: stretch test, skin adhesion (apply/remove 5× on forearm), color fastness (wet)
- TENS pads: adhesion after 30 applications, connector fit on standard 2mm TENS unit
- Ultrasound gel: viscosity, water solubility, no skin reaction (patch test)
- Resistance bands: tensile test (break test at 5× rated resistance)

## 5. Open Questions Before Launch

1. **AcuMax exact prices** — Must check their actual CHF pricing on tape, gel, and electrode pads. If they're already at ≤CHF 5 for kinesiology tape rolls, our margin shrinks. **Verdict-determining.**
2. **Swissmedic pre-consultation** — Do a free pre-submission enquiry with Swissmedic on: (a) whether kinesiology tape requires notification, (b) classification of ultrasound gel, (c) TENS pad import procedure
3. **Physioswiss advertising** — Can we advertise in their member newsletter/portal? Cost?
4. **massagebedarf.ch pricing** — Need to check their actual tape and gel prices
5. **Chinese supplier DoC quality** — Request sample CE Declarations of Conformity from Quanding and Aupcon before committing to bulk
